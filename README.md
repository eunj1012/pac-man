# Pac-man
Programming Pac-man to move back and forth across the screen was the assignment for Week 4.

Using the "waka waka waka" movements (mouth opening and closing), I have Pac-Man moving across the screen one way until it reaches the end, where it then switches direction.

Hopefully, I can come back to this repository and update it so it makes sound effects and control it's movements using the arrow keys.
